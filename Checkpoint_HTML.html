        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Tozeur</strong> was historically an important stopping point
          for caravans crossing the Sahara, a place to rest and refuel before
          heading deeper into the dessert. It was also used as an important
          Roman outpost and has since been ruled by a variety of tribes
          including the Berbers for much of its history, who have perhaps the
          most influence on the city’s historic architecture.

              <strong>palm grove</strong>, one of the biggest in the country and
              also one of the most beautiful. Around 350 000 palm trees, spread
              on 2 000 ha, creating a true jungle, consisting of three layers of
              vegetation: culture fields, fruit trees, and the palm trees.

              <strong>Chott el Jerid</strong> is a salt plain, aka a mirage. I
              always had thought that mirages were hallucinations, it’s not,
              it’s more of an optical illusion. Salt plains are frequent in the
              Sahara, and the reflection of the sun on the salt makes it looks
              like there’s water. This Chott is a top-place to visit while in

              the town 'Mos Espa' or 'Mos Eisley' have been filmed here. Tours
